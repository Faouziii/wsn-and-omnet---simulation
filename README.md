wsn-and-omnet---simulation
==========================

omnet++  simulation of wireless sensor networks with multi target tracking using data mules, collecting data and then transmitted to the base station or the sink. data mules are mobile sensors that capture data from sensors in its range and finally take it to the sink thus reducing power consumption by sensor nodes.
